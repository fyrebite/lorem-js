## How to Use
1. Download the lorem.js file
2. Add the script reference to the __<head>__ of your html file:
```html
<script src="lorem.js"></script>
```
3. Whenever you need some placeholder text, call a new script tag, along with the __lorem__ function and how many words you need:
```html
<script>lorem(10);</script>
4. That's it!
